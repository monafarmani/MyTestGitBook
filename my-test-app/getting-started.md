# ðŸš€ Getting Started

Welcome to MyTestSDK! This guide will help you get started with integrating and using our library in your Android projects.

## Introduction

MyTestSDK is a powerful and versatile library that provides a great analysis on the way people drive their cars. By using MyTestSDK, you can Have precise control over driving, monitoring the driver's intelligence while driving, and issuing warnings when there is a risk of an accident..



## prerequisites

Before you begin using MyTestSDK, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed and set up in your development environment:

* Install the latest version of Android studio.
* Install [mapbox ](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/maps/guides/install/)SDK for Android and get access token.

## To use My Test library, follow these steps:

1. Open your Android project in Android Studio.
2. Add the following lines to settings.gradle:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Groovy" %}
```kotlin
allprojects {
	repositories {
		maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	}
}	
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Kts" %}
```kotlin
repositories {
        maven ("https://jitpack.io")
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The `settings.gradle` file in Android Studio is a configuration file that is used to define the settings and modules for your project. It is located in the root directory of your project, alongside the `build.gradle` file.

Some key aspects of the `settings.gradle` file include Project Structure, Module Inclusion, Module Names and Multi-Module Projects.

3. Add the following lines to your app-level `build.gradle` file:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Groovy" %}
```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.monafarmani:new:0.0.12'
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Kts" %}
```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation ("com.github.monafarmani:new:0.0.12")
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

In Android Studio, the `build.gradle` file is a configuration file that is used to define various settings and dependencies for your Android project. It is located in the root directory of your project, as well as in each module (such as the app module) within the project.

4. We need to implement settings for map box because it is used in our library, so add the following lines to settings.gradle too:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Groovy" %}
```kotlin
allprojects {
    repositories {
      maven {
            url 'https://api.mapbox.com/downloads/v2/releases/maven'
            authentication {
                basic(BasicAuthentication)
            }
            credentials {
                username = "mapbox"
                password = "MAPBOX_SECRET_KEY"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Kts" %}
```kotlin
repositories {
    maven {
        url = uri("https://api.mapbox.com/downloads/v2/releases/maven")
        authentication {
            create<BasicAuthentication>("basic")
        }
        credentials {
            username = "mapbox"
            password = "MAPBOX_SECRET_KEY"
        }
    }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

5. Sync your project with Gradle.

Locate the toolbar at the top of the Android Studio window. There, you should see a series of icons, including a circular arrow icon labeled "Sync Project with Gradle Files."

* If the icon is highlighted and clickable, it means the project is not synchronized with the `build.gradle` files.
* If the icon is grayed out, it means the project is already synchronized.



## Using the SDK in your Android Application

### &#x20;<mark style="color:purple;">Initialize the SDK</mark>

To initialize the SDK, you will need to create a new instance of the Application class in your app's module:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Kotlin" %}
```kotlin
class Application : Application() {

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        Gizo.initialize(
            this,
            GizoApp.GizoAppOptions.Builder().build()
        )
    }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

In the example above, we create a new instance of the Application class and call the initialize method to initialize the sdk.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Kotlin" %}
```kotlin
<application
    android:name=".Application"
>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

In the examole above, we add some lines of code to AndroidManifest.xml as well.

In the AndroidManifest.xml file, the `<application>` element is used to define the characteristics and configurations of your Android application. The `android:name` attribute within the `<application>` element specifies the name of the class that represents the application itself.

**Note:** For using features of the sdk you need to add [Model ](usage/app-options-setting/gizoanalysissettings.md)and required [App Options Setting](usage/app-options-setting/) in the following steps.
