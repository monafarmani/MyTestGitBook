# model

## overview

In Android Studio, object detection and depth estimation can be implemented using machine learning models, such as those built with TensorFlow, and deployed using the TensorFlow Lite library.&#x20;

object detection models are useful for any application that requires accurate and efficient detection and localization of objects in images and video streams.&#x20;

depth estimation models are useful for any application that requires accurate and efficient estimation of the depth or distance of objects in a scene.
