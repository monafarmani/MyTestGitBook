# model

## overview

In our sdk we require accurate and efficient detection and localization of objects in images and video streams and also require accurate and efficient estimation of the depth or distance of objects in a scene.

In Android Studio, object detection and depth estimation can be implemented using machine learning models, such as those built with TensorFlow, and deployed using the TensorFlow Lite library.&#x20;
