## Basics:

### Permissions Required

The following permissions are required by the SDK:

#### <mark style="color:blue;">ACCESS\_COARSE\_LOCATION</mark>

The ACCESS\_COARSE\_LOCATION permission is required to obtain the user's approximate location. This permission is used to provide location-based services to the user, such as displaying relevant content based on their location.

**Note**: This permission does not grant access to the user's precise location or any other location-related features, such as the ability to track the user's movements.

To request the ACCESS\_COARSE\_LOCATION permission in your app, add the following line to your app's Manifest file:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="xml" %}
```kotlin
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### <mark style="color:blue;">ACCESS\_FINE\_LOCATION</mark>&#x20;

The ACCESS\_FINE\_LOCATION permission is required to obtain the user's precise location. This permission is used to provide location-based services to the user, such as displaying nearby points of interest or providing turn-by-turn directions.

**Note**: This permission grants access to the user's precise location data, which can be used to track the user's movements. Make sure to handle the user's location data responsibly and in accordance with your app's privacy policy.

To request the ACCESS\_FINE\_LOCATION permission in your app, add the following line to your app's Manifest file:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="xml" %}
```kotlin
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### <mark style="color:blue;">CAMERA</mark>

&#x20;The CAMERA permission is required to capture images and scan QR codes. Without this permission, the SDK will not be able to perform these functions.

**Note**: This permission does not grant access to other camera-related features, such as the microphone or location data.

To request the CAMERA permission in your app, add the following line to your app's Manifest file:



{% tabs %}
{% tab title="xml" %}
```kotlin
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### <mark style="color:blue;">ACCESS\_NETWORK\_STATE</mark>

The ACCESS\_NETWORK\_STATE permission is required to determine the user's network connectivity status. This permission is used to check if the user is connected to the internet or not, and to adjust the SDK's behavior accordingly.

To request the ACCESS\_NETWORK\_STATE permission in your app, add the following line to your app's Manifest file:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="xml" %}
```kotlin
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### <mark style="color:blue;">READ\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE</mark>

The READ\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE permission is required to read files from the user's external storage, such as photos or documents. This permission is used to enable features of the SDK that require access to the user's files, such as file upload or import functionality.

**Note**: This permission does not grant access to other external storage-related features, such as the ability to delete files.

To request the READ\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE permission in your app, add the following line to your app's Manifest file:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="xml" %}
```kotlin
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### <mark style="color:blue;">WRITE\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE</mark>

&#x20;The WRITE\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE permission is required to write files to the user's external storage, such as saving photos or documents. This permission is used to enable features of the SDK that require the ability to save files, such as file download or export functionality.

**Note**: This permission does not grant access to other external storage-related features, such as the ability to delete files.

To request the WRITE\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE permission in your app, add the following line to your app's Manifest file:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="xml" %}
```kotlin
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Request Permissions

The example below shows how to request permissions for a method that requires both `CAMERA` and `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permissions. There are a few things to note:

* Using `EasyPermissions#hasPermissions(...)` to check if the app already has the required permissions. This method can take any number of permissions as its final argument.
* Requesting permissions with `EasyPermissions#requestPermissions`. This method will request the system permissions and show the rationale string provided if necessary. The request code provided should be unique to this request, and the method can take any number of permissions as its final argument.
* Use of the `AfterPermissionGranted` annotation. This is optional, but provided for convenience. If all of the permissions in a given request are granted, _all_ methods annotated with the proper request code will be executed(be sure to have an unique request code). The annotated method needs to be _void_ and _without input parameters_ (instead, you can use _onSaveInstanceState_ in order to keep the state of your suppressed parameters). This is to simplify the common flow of needing to run the requesting method after all of its permissions have been granted. This can also be achieved by adding logic on the `onPermissionsGranted` callback.

```
@AfterPermissionGranted(RC_CAMERA_AND_LOCATION)
private void methodRequiresTwoPermission() {
    String[] perms = {Manifest.permission.CAMERA, Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION};
    if (EasyPermissions.hasPermissions(this, perms)) {
        // Already have permission, do the thing
        // ...
    } else {
        // Do not have permissions, request them now
        EasyPermissions.requestPermissions(this, getString(R.string.camera_and_location_rationale),
                RC_CAMERA_AND_LOCATION, perms);
    }
}
```

Or for finer control over the rationale dialog, use a `PermissionRequest`:

```
EasyPermissions.requestPermissions(
        new PermissionRequest.Builder(this, RC_CAMERA_AND_LOCATION, perms)
                .setRationale(R.string.camera_and_location_rationale)
                .setPositiveButtonText(R.string.rationale_ask_ok)
                .setNegativeButtonText(R.string.rationale_ask_cancel)
                .setTheme(R.style.my_fancy_style)
                .build());
```

Optionally, for a finer control, you can have your `Activity` / `Fragment` implement the `PermissionCallbacks` interface.

```
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements EasyPermissions.PermissionCallbacks {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
    }

    @Override
    public void onRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode, String[] permissions, int[] grantResults) {
        super.onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults);

        // Forward results to EasyPermissions
        EasyPermissions.onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults, this);
    }

    @Override
    public void onPermissionsGranted(int requestCode, List<String> list) {
        // Some permissions have been granted
        // ...
    }

    @Override
    public void onPermissionsDenied(int requestCode, List<String> list) {
        // Some permissions have been denied
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Required Permissions

In some cases your app will not function properly without certain permissions. If the user denies these permissions with the "Never Ask Again" option, you will be unable to request these permissions from the user and they must be changed in app settings. You can use the method `EasyPermissions.somePermissionPermanentlyDenied(...)` to display a dialog to the user in this situation and direct them to the system setting screen for your app:

**Note**: Due to a limitation in the information provided by the Android framework permissions API, the `somePermissionPermanentlyDenied` method only works after the permission has been denied and your app has received the `onPermissionsDenied` callback. Otherwise the library cannot distinguish permanent denial from the "not yet denied" case.

```
@Override
public void onPermissionsDenied(int requestCode, List<String> perms) {
    Log.d(TAG, "onPermissionsDenied:" + requestCode + ":" + perms.size());

    // (Optional) Check whether the user denied any permissions and checked "NEVER ASK AGAIN."
    // This will display a dialog directing them to enable the permission in app settings.
    if (EasyPermissions.somePermissionPermanentlyDenied(this, perms)) {
        new AppSettingsDialog.Builder(this).build().show();
    }
}

@Override
public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);

    if (requestCode == AppSettingsDialog.DEFAULT_SETTINGS_REQ_CODE) {
        // Do something after user returned from app settings screen, like showing a Toast.
        Toast.makeText(this, R.string.returned_from_app_settings_to_activity, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT)
                .show();
    }
}
```

## Interacting with the rationale dialog

Implement the `EasyPermissions.RationaleCallbacks` if you want to interact with the rationale dialog.@Override

```
public void onRationaleAccepted(int requestCode) {
    // Rationale accepted to request some permissions
    // ...
}

@Override
public void onRationaleDenied(int requestCode) {
    // Rationale denied to request some permissions
    // ...
}
```

Rationale callbacks don't necessarily imply permission changes. To check for those, see the `EasyPermissions.PermissionCallbacks`.

## How to use the library in a fragment





## Styling

The library supports day-night modes. The dependents may use the following styling attributes to create a dedicated style for `AboutPage`. If the dependents choose not to specify an explicit style, the library falls back to sensible defaults.

First, declare an `AboutPage` style in your `styles.xml`.

```
<!-- Define a global style for AboutPage in your 'styles.xml' -->
<style name="Widget.App.AboutPage" parent="about_About">
  <item name="aboutBackground">#ffffff</item>
  <item name="aboutElementIconTint">#333333</item>
  <item name="aboutSeparatorColor">#999999</item>
  <item name="aboutDescriptionTextAppearance">@style/TextAppearance.App.AboutPage.Description</item>

  <!-- similarly, you can also apply the following text appearances -->
  <item name="aboutElementTextAppearance">@style/about_elementTextAppearance.Dark</item>
  <item name="aboutGroupTextAppearance">@style/about_groupTextAppearance</item>
</style>

<style name="TextAppearance.App.AboutPage.Description" parent="about_descriptionTextAppearance.Dark">
  <item name="android:textStyle">bold|italic</item>
</style>
```

To apply this style globally, assign its reference to `aboutStyle` attribute in your app theme.

```
<style name="Theme.App" parent="Theme.AppCompat">
  <item name="aboutStyle">@style/Widget.AboutPage</item>
</style>
```

Or explicitly pass the style resource to the `AboutPage` constructor to apply it on selective `AboutPage` instances.

```
AboutPage aboutPage = new AboutPage(context, R.style.Widget_AboutPage);

```

## &#x20;Force Night/Day mode

We recommend that the dependents use [`AppCompatDelegate.setDefaultNightMode()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/appcompat/app/AppCompatDelegate#setDefaultNightMode\(int\)) to force enable/disable the night mode across their apps. If the dependents are unable to use the recommended approach, they can use the `AboutPage(Context, boolean)` constructor to specify the desired mode. The dependents must note that by using this constructor, the `AboutPage` will use its default styles, ignoring any explicitly specified style.

```
AboutPage aboutPage = AboutPage(context, true); // force enable dark mode.
AboutPage aboutPage = AboutPage(context, false); // force enable bright mode.

```
