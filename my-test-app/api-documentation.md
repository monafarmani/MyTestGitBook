# ðŸ“– API Documentation

## Overview

API documentation serves as a reference guide for developers and users to understand how to interact with an API effectively. It provides detailed explanations, instructions, and examples on how to make API requests, handle responses, and utilize various features and functionalities.

Our API documentation is generated using **Swagger**, an open-source framework that simplifies the process of designing, building, documenting, and consuming APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). It provides a set of tools and specifications that help developers describe, document, and visualize the structure and behavior of their APIs.



## Endpoints

Here are the list of all the available endpoints or routes provided by the API

#### [Authentication](api-documentation/authentication.md)

#### [User](api-documentation/user.md)

#### [Car](api-documentation/car.md)

#### [Trip](api-documentation/trip.md)

#### [Emergency Contact](api-documentation/emergency-contact.md)

#### [Settings](api-documentation/settings.md)



## Errors

In case of errors, the API may return the following HTTP status codes along with error responses:

* 400 Bad Request: Invalid request parameters or missing required fields.
* 401 Unauthorized: Missing or invalid API key.
* 404 Not Found: The requested resource does not exist.
* 500 Internal Server Error: An unexpected error occurred on the server.



## Rate Limiting

The API enforces rate limiting to ensure fair usage. Each API key is limited to 100 requests per minute. If the rate limit is exceeded, a response with status code 429 "Too Many Requests" will be returned.
