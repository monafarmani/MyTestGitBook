# ðŸ“– API Documentation

## Overview

API documentation serves as a reference guide for developers and users to understand how to interact with an API effectively. It provides detailed explanations, instructions, and examples on how to make API requests, handle responses, and utilize various features and functionalities.

Our API documentation is generated using **Swagger**, an open-source framework that simplifies the process of designing, building, documenting, and consuming APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). It provides a set of tools and specifications that help developers describe, document, and visualize the structure and behavior of their APIs.
